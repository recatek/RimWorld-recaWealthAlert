# RimWorld-recaWealthAlert

Adds an alert (right-side persistent indicator) on the RimWorld UI of your current wealth for the current colony.

To use, put in your RimWorld/Mods directory (e.g. RimWorld/Mods/recaWealthAlert).

I always recommend building from source (and checking it!) for safety with C# RimWorld mods. If this directory is placed in your RimWorld/Mods directory, the .sln file should "just work" with Visual Studio. Build in Release mode for best performance.

Alternatively, I've included the release .dll in the 1.6/Assemblies directory, so this mod should work out of the box if just downloaded. As above, I recommend checking downloaded C# RimWorld mod DLLs with [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) before using, as a precaution against both malice and stupidity.

Let me know if there are any problems by opening an issue on this repository. Happy wealth management!
